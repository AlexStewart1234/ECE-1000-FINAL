# ECE-1000-FINAL
This GitHub contains all relevant files used during development of our automatic plant watering system project for ECE 1000.
## Project Summary
With the increasing demand for automated solutions in everyday life, our team developed an "Automatic Plant Watering System" that uses a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. This project is significant because it reduces the risk of overwatering or underwatering plants, a common issue for those with busy schedules or minimal gardening experience.

## Project Capabilities
The following details the current capabilities of the automatic watering system:

*Detect wetness level of anything in contact with the sensor.
*If the level is below a given threshold dispense water for a period of time.
*Recheck the level, and if it is above the threshold stop dispensing until it crosses the threshold again.
